st.write("`Eyringpy` is a program for computing rate constants using the " 
         "transition state theory (TST), in the gas phase and in solution."
         "The Gibbs activation energy is obtained by computing from scratch"
         " the canonical partition functions. Unimolecular and bimolecular"
         " reactions with one or two products are supported. Rate constants of"
         " bimolecular reactions involving the formation of pre-reactive"
         " and/or product complexes are also estimated. The reaction symmetry"
         " is considered. One-dimensional Wigner and Eckart tunneling"
         " corrections are also available. To compute rate constants in"
         " solution,`Eyringpy` employs the Collinsâ€“Kimball theory to include"
         " the diffusion-limit, the Marcus theory for electron transfer (ET)"
         " processes, and the molar fractions to account for the effect of pH"
         " in aqueous reactions.")
